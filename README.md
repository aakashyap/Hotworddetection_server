# Hotworddetection_server
Server side solution using Python to make IoT devices/voice assistant bots respond to specific hotwords. Your device/bot can be used completely as a hands free device. No need to press any buttons to activate command listening mode, just say the hotword of your choice like "Hey device" and your device will go in a mode where it will start comprehending any commands given after the hotword. This is made using the model provided by KITT.AI -"snowboy hotword detection model".
